# NBA Elo Simulator

Inspired by [Mr V's Garage F1 ELO Engine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U16a8tdrbII&t=329s), this project aims to simulate an Elo engine on NBA game data. 

Note: All data used in this project was web scraped from [basketball-reference.com](https://www.basketball-reference.com/).
